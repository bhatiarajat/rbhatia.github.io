My mention of a <a href="https://twitter.com/wef/status/949190765099520000">tweet from the World Economic Forum</a> to make a point about how well the Indian goverment is performing on its clean energy mission drew a quick response about 'deceitful numbers' from the wife. The argumentative me tried to fight back, but it was clear that I had succumbed to the deception.

In his book 'How to Lie with Statistics', Darrel Huff says:
>If you canâ€™t prove what you want to prove, demonstrate something else and pretend that they are the same thing. In the daze that follows the collision of statistics with the human mind, hardly anybody will notice the difference. 

We read often about the way graphs and figures can be misused to drive the readers to a conclusion, however, the misuse that we are talking about in this case is more about questions that are left unanswered in both the tweet as well as the hyperlinked article. Yes, the chart does show an x-fold increase in the annual rooftop installations in India in the last few years. Even if these numbers are accepted at face value, the article does not provide answers to multiple questions about what influenced this increase in installations, how many of these were installed by government versus private, and further into private, what was the ratio of installations by individuals versus those by businesses. In the absence of this information, the article's claims are meaningless.
