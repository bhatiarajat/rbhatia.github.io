The long break between school and work has meant that I am able to spend a lot of time in the library. During my search for books on Python, I found a book called Two Scoops of Django, about a web development framework called Django. Even though I had no clue about what Django is, I found the book name intriguing and decided to loan it. I have been reading the book since last night, and was not able to make any sense out of it initially. However, after browsing a few online resources, I have grasped basics of it at the very least. So here is a synopsis.

**What is Django and why use it?**
Django is an open-source high level Python web framework, which gives the users less freedom but is good for beginners and for developing functionality very quickly. Even though it is simple, it is fully featured and fully loaded and provides users with complete functionality of building web apps. 

**MVC versus MTV:**
Django is put into the Model-Template-View (MTV) category rather than Model-View-Controller (MVC). The C is handled directly by the framework in the case of Django. Everything related to interaction with data goes into the data access layer, or in other words, in Model. The presentation related steps go into Template, and all the display related steps go into the business layer, or View.

Django works on the concept of app, wherein every website is divided into various apps. For example, an online shopping website would have apps for reviews, descriptions, and payment, among others.

Will write about the steps about creating a first app with Django in the next post. However, to set up the system, all that is needed is Python (3.x) installed and XAMPP for MySQL.
