While clearing my old hard disk recently I came across some notes that I had made a few years back while going through a book on data analytics. Below are excerpts from it.

<b> Introduction </b>

When two variables are related to one another, they are said to be <b>correlated</b>. Correlations are also called <i>tendencies</i> (‘taller people tend to weigh more basically means that height and weight are correlated’). If we can quantify the strength and direction of this relationship, that gives us the ability to predict one variable using our knowledge of the other variable. However, it must be noted that <b> Correlation is not causation </b>

The process used to estimate the strength of a relationship is called <b>correlation analysis</b>, and the closely related process used to predict one variable from another is called <b>regression analysis</b>.

A <b>scatter plot</b> helps in analyzing ‘relationships’, and it can be quantifying using the Pearson correlation coefficient. This can be calculated in Excel using the formula <b>=CORREL(range1,range2)</b>.
