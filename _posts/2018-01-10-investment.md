Picking stocks is not an art. If picking stocks was an art, it would be mere speculation. In this story I will talk about the things you look at while picking stocks worth investing. 

**1. Sales:** should be growing; the growth percentage would vary by industry, but it should be higher than the industry average <br>
**2. Earnings:** should be growing by at least 10% <br>
**3. Debt:** should be declining <br>
**4. Equity:** should be growing <br>
**5. Valuation or P/E:** lower the better, certainly less than 30<br>
**6. Debt/Asset Ratio:** debt should be less than half of assets<br>
**7. Return on Equity:** should be growing by at least 10% year on year<br>
**8. Company's competitive advantages**<br>
