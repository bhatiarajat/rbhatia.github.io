Picked up a book in the library today, with the appealing name "The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing". Who doesn't want to learn a quick way to pick stocks, make money, and get rich? Turns out, the book is about much more than just a list of 5 things to know. In fact, the 5 rules are just one chapter out of a 350 page book consisting of 26 chapters. I have read around 100 pages so far and have found the content pretty interesting, so sharing some excerpts in this story.

***Introduction***
The book begins with a brief introduction of things most people tell you. Such as, 'your goal as an investor should be to find wonderful businesses and purchase them at reasonable prices' and 'company fundamentals have a direct effect on share prices'. The book also talks about why long term investing would invariably be more beneficial than short term trading. And it is not just the obvious reason of 'being able to reap the rewards of finding a company with strong fundamentals'. A good reason is that 'betting on short-term price movements means doing a large amount of trading, which leads to (1) taxes on short-term capital gains, which can be almost double the rate of long term capital gains and (2) higher transaction costs via more frequent commissions.

***The 5 Rules***
The 5 core principles named by the book are:

**1 Do your homework:** learn accounting concepts and the basic research process <br>

**2 Find economic moats:** the author defines *economic moat* as a firm's competitive advantage that helps it keep competitors at bay. The way to analyze a company's economic moat is by following these four checks:

I. Evaluating financial results, to find firms that generate: <br>
(1) operating profits (mainly to ensure that it is past the money-losing stage) <br>
(2) free cash flow that is at least 5% of sales, <br>
(3) net margins above 15%,<br>
(4) returns on equity above 15% (measures net income as a percentage of shareholders' equity, in other words, profits per dollar of the shareholders' investment)<br>
(5) returns on assets above 6% (measures how efficient a firm is at translating its assets into profits)

II. Finding firms that fulfil above criteria is not enough, we also need to understand the reasons of such performance. All these reasons may not necessarily demonstrate an investment-worthy stock.<br>
(1) real product differentiation: Marketing folks talk about product differentiation very highly, however, Morningstar says that simply having a better technology or more features is **not** a sustainable strategy because bigger and more powerful competitors may scale these differences at any time.<br>
(2) perceived product differentiation: if a brand increases consumers' willingness to pay, and it translates into positive returns for the firm.<br>
(3) low costs: low costs are a very powerful source of advantage, whether these low costs are achieved with the help of a higher scale, or through better processes. <br>
(4) locking-in customers: invariably done through creating high switching costs or by providing additional advantages to existing customers; case in point being Amazon Prime

III. Analyzing the industry is an equally important step of identifying economic moats, since all industries behave differently. Looking at a variety of firms in the industry over a 10 year period would give an indication of whether the industry is growing or shrinking, whether firms are consistently profitable or going through periodic cycles, among other things.

**3 Have a margin of safety:** estimate companies' value and then buy those stocks which are trading at a price below there estimated value. This difference is what the author defines as the margin of safety.

*Valuation:* The most popular valuation metric is price-to-earning ratio (P/E), which may be compared with the market, with other similar firms, or with the firm's own historical P/E. The lower the P/E, the better it is; and in any case, the P/E should be less than 30. <br>
*Intrinsic Value:* Apart from knowing whether a stock is valuable or not, it is essential to understand what the true value of a stock should be so that we may find whether it is worth buying at its current market price or not. Morningstar has given a 5 step valuation model for calculating a stock's value as shown in the attached image.

**4 Hold for the long haul:** commit to your investments like you commit to your major purchases such as your car or your refrigerator. The author gives a very good illustration of the difference in long term returns for two figurative investors, shown in the image below. <br>

**5 Know when to sell:** the key to knowing when to sell a stock is in not selling on the basis of whether the stock's price has suddenly dropped or skyrocketed. The selling decision needs to follow a similar analysis as buying, where you examine whether the company's fundamentals have deteriorated, the stock has moved past its intrinsic value, or if there are simply better investment opportunities elsewhere. <br>
