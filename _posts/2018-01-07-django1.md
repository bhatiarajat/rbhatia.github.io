I heavily used online resources for creating my first app in addition to the <a href="https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11">book</a> I quoted in my earlier post. As a first step, I installed the Python Virtual Environment through the terminal using the command: 
> pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

After this, I took the terminal to my Projects folder using the command:

> PS C:\Users\Rajat Bhatia> cd PythonProjects

to get to here: PS C:\Users\Rajat Bhatia\PythonProjects>

My next task was to create a virtual environment, using the command:

> PS C:\Users\Rajat Bhatia\PythonProjects> mkvirtualenv py1

Running this command did some weird things to my computer, but after about 10 seconds, gave me the DONE response.

This is when we finally install Django, using the command:

> PS C:\Users\Rajat Bhatia\PythonProjects> pip install django

To create a new project, the following command is run:

> PS C:\Users\Rajat Bhatia\PythonProjects>django-admin startproject djangoproject

where djangoproject is just the name of the new project being created. By using the $$dir$ command, we can see the list of all directories. The recently created djangoproject directory would be listed there, and we would like to enter it by using the command $$cd djangoproject$. To see what this directory looks like, we can give the command $$atom .$, which will take us to the atom texteditor. We can explore all the pre-installed pages that are created when we create a new project in Django using the Atom editor.
