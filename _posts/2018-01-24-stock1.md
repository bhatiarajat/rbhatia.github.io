As my first python project, I would be building a stock picker. The components of this project would be:
1- a website for front end user input and final user output (in the form of stock name or stock symbol)
2- web scraping to get information about the queried stock
3- data manipulation and analytics for showcasing stock health on different parameters
4- machine learning for predicting stock price 

This is what I foresee it to look like.

I would start from step 2 and build a web scraping application using python libraries request and beautifulsoup.
